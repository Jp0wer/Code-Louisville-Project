# Code-Louisville-Project
This is a music library of original instrumentals I wrote, recorded and produced. Navigate thru the page by clicking the title of the audio. An image will appear that suits the vibe of the audio file. Click play and enjoy. The images were taken from google images and are not of my creation. All pictures will be hidden except for the one that corresponds with the title last clicked. Enjoy!
